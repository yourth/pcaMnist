# PCA MNIST Model sample

This example notebook shows how to use PCA model for the MNIST dataset.

It demonstrates the following:
* Basic setup for using SageMaker.
* Read the MNIST dataset from an existing repository into memory.
* Inspect the dataset.
* Convert datasets from numpy to dense tensor.
* Upload dataset to S3.
* Training SageMaker's PCA model on the dataset.
* Hosting the trained model.
* Scoring using the trained model.
